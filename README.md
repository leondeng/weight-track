<h1>Project</h1>

<h2>Daily weight goal & progress recording web application</h2>

Please build a small web application that allows a user to track their daily weight progress.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
As a user I want to be able to<br>

● enter a weight loss goal so I can have something to aim for<br>

● submit a new weight entry for a specific day<br>

● edit or remove a previous entry in case I made a mistake<br>

● view my past entries, with a maximum of 10 shown per page<br>

● (EXTRA CREDIT) view a visualisation (graph or similar) of my progress towards my goal<br>
</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
● Use any framework or libraries you wish<br>

● User interaction with the database should ONLY occur using REST requests (apart from full page GET requests). So you’ll need to build a simple RESTful API<br>

● You should have at least one (hopefully more) unit / acceptance tests (eg. PHPUnit / Codeception or similar ­ your choice)<br>

● No need to build a user system or authentication ­ hardcode, simulate or assume the user has authenticated<br>

● The design of the user interface will not be part of your test, but the implementation of the HTML / CSS / JS will be. It should look functional and finished (albeit simple / clean). Using Bootstrap / Foundation or similar is acceptable and encouraged. Your interface should be as functional and usable on a mobile phone as it is on the desktop<br>
